# HORISEON Week 1 Challenge

Horiseon is a company that provides search engine optimazion solutions. upon gaining access of the initial I created Horiseon Week 1 challenge and uploaded it under the main branch to provide me with a working copy. I then created a development branch to to work and develop the existing code and make sure it held up to the original website.

the challenge that was given & Acceptance Criteria was as follows

### user story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Lessons Learned

The challenge was designed to support what we learned in class. it implements the basic knowledge of HTML & CSS. Upon recieving the websites code I immediatly notice the broken anchor on search engine optimization and fixed it so it would jump to the right section of the website. I then shifted my focus on the CSS and begin to clean up the repeative code and removed the reliance on pointless classes. I also implemented semantic HTML and was able to elimenate the header and the footer class and made the CSS rely on the HTML tags for that portion. I also updated both the head title and the image descriptions both play an important role in search engine optimization of the site. The last thing I did to the code to simplfy and make it easyier to read was group the CSS code by its section and add coments to both the CSS & HTML.
